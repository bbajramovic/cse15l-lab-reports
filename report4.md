To log into ieng6, I had to go into bash terminal, and type `ssh cs15lfa23mw@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu` <enter>, which logged me right away into my account without the password. The ssh command allows
us to log into ssh with our username following the command.

To git clone the ssh link, I went to the github website, forked the repository "Lab7", then from my fork, I clicked on the "code" button, and copied the SSH link <control>+<c>. In terminal,
I typed the commmand `git clone git@github.com:bbajramovic/lab7.git` <enter> which cloned my forked repository with the SSH link. The `git clone ` command, followed by a link to a repository, 
is a git command used to create a copy of a remorte Git repository and copy it to our local machine.

To run the buggy tests, I had to cd into the directory using `cd lab7` <enter> first. Then I ran the command `bash test.sh` <enter> to run the tests. `cd` means "change directory" which changes
our current directory into the one that we want to be in to run our commands. `bash ` followed by a bash script is a command used to execute a bash script.
